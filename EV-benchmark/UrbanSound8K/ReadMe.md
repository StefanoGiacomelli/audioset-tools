# UrbanSound8K - Preparation Guide

This file provides instructions on downloading, extracting, and formatting [UrbanSound8K dataset](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) to be ready for use. Follow the steps below to set up the dataset properly.

Commands pipeline is tested on Unix-based systems.

## 1. Download

Download the dataset filling the official form (from the Official Site, link above reccomended) and move contents inside this folder, or run:
```bash
cd ./EV-benchmark/UrbanSound8K/

pip install soundata

python3
import soundata
dataset = soundata.initialize('urbansound8k')
dataset.download()              # download the dataset
dataset.validate()              # validate that all the expected files are there
```

## 2. UnZip contents (only if downloaded from the Official Site, reccomended)

Unzip contents in the CWD with:
```bash
unzip UrbanSound8K.tar.gz
ls                              # Output: audio, metadata
